# EKG-Build

The goal of this project is to use embedded systems design to create a hand-held portable EKG that is able to analyze periodic analog input signals and determine heart rate, while producing an output analog signal that can be stored in Microcontroller memory

## Overview

For this project, the task was to design a hand-held portable instrument 
that would analyze a periodic analog input signal i.e. an EKG (electrocardiogram). I was tasked with determining the rate of the analog input signal (heart rate) as well as producing an output analog signal, voltage, that could be stored in Microcontroller memory. Over a period of three months, I learned and designed the software for the PIT, Switches, ADC (analog to digital converter), DAC (digital to analog converter), LCD display, and my menu. I assembled the hardware for my NXP FRDM-KL25Z board attachments (circuit board with switches, LEDs, and LCD), and connected them to the NXP Microcontroller. At the end of the project, I assembled the hardware for a complete circuit board including the MKL25Z processor, 25LC128 memory, switches, and LCD display. I completed about 90% of the project. I had 5 out of the 7 working modes. I was not able to accomplish storing a previously sampled data amount and downloading anything to external memory due to lack of time and I was not able to communicate with the all-in-one designed circuit board for unknown reasons.

## Theory

The device created in this project is a portable handheld 
electrocardiogram. This analyzed an analog input signal, 
specifically from the heart, and allows a user to do multiple 
things with this data. Data can be stored in customized 
amounts and at different rates. The analog signal can also be 
output to a device such as an oscilloscope. The device currently 
needs to be powered by a USB port, but has potential for being 
battery powered in the future. The handheld device is 2.03 in x 
1.02 in x 6.5 in (LxWxH). The device can operate at low 
frequencies to frequencies at about 15 Hz.
